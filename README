# PROG 01: Beer Belly Buster (aka Crunch Time)

Beer Belly Buster helps you, the data-driven user, track and optimize your workouts. Simply select a type of exercise, input in the number of minutes or repetitions, and calculate how many calories (or beers) are burned! Plus you get a list of equivalent exercises and their durations. Tracking how many calories you've worked off just got that much easier.
